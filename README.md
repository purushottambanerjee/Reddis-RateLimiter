#🚀 Redis Rate Limiting Demo Application
Welcome to the Redis Rate Limiting Demo! This is a simple yet powerful application built with Spring Boot and Redis that demonstrates how you can easily implement rate limiting to protect your APIs from abuse and overuse.

With this demo, you’ll see how Redis helps in tracking and controlling the number of requests per user, and how to efficiently handle rate-limiting exceptions using HTTP 429 Too Many Requests.

#💡 Key Features
Rate Limiting: Limit the number of requests users can make within a specified time window (e.g., 5 requests per minute).
Redis Integration: Uses Redis to track request counts for each user and reset them after the time window expires.
White-Listing: Easily bypass rate limits for certain users.
Custom Error Handling: Returns a clean, informative error message with a 429 HTTP Status when users exceed the rate limit.
Minimal Setup: All you need is Docker, Spring Boot, and Redis. A couple of commands, and you’re up and running!
#🛠 Prerequisites
To get started, you’ll need the following:

Docker (for running Redis in a container)
Java 11+ (to run the Spring Boot application)
Maven or Gradle (to build the project)
Redis (we’ll use Docker to run it!)
#🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/redis-rate-limiting-demo.git
cd redis-rate-limiting-demo
2. Run Redis with Docker
If you don’t have Redis installed, don’t worry! You can quickly spin up a Redis container with Docker.

bash
Copy
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
This will start Redis in the background and expose it on port 6379. Now Redis is ready to store request counts!

3. Build and Run the Application
Build and run the Spring Boot application using Maven or Gradle.

With Maven:

bash
Copy
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
With Gradle:

bash
Copy
./gradlew build
./gradlew bootRun
Your application will start on http://localhost:8080.

#🔥 How It Works
Rate Limiting in Action
Track Requests: Each user’s request count is stored in Redis under a key like rate_limit:{username}.
Limit Requests: If a user exceeds the rate limit (e.g., more than 5 requests in 60 seconds), a RateLimitException is thrown.
White-List: Special users (e.g., admin) are exempt from rate limiting.
Rate Limit Logic
Max Requests: 5 requests per user within 60 seconds.
Redis: Tracks the request count for each user.
Key Expiry: After 60 seconds, Redis automatically expires the request count, resetting it.
When the rate limit is exceeded, the app throws an exception with HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status.

#⚙️ Monitoring Redis
Want to see the rate-limiting in action? You can monitor Redis using the Redis CLI or a GUI tool like RedisInsight.

Using Redis CLI
To check the request count for a user:

bash..
Copy

docker exec -it redis redis-cli get rate_limit:{username}
To see how many seconds are left until the key expires:

bash..
Copy
docker exec -it redis redis-cli ttl rate_limit:{username}
Using RedisInsight
Download RedisInsight.
Connect to your Redis instance running on Docker at localhost:6379.
View the rate-limiting keys, their values, and TTL in a user-friendly interface!

#🧑‍💻 Example Usage
User Makes Requests: A user makes requests to the API, and their request count in Redis increases (e.g., rate_limit:john_doe becomes 1, 2, 3...).

Exceeded Rate Limit: Once the user hits the max requests (5 in our case), the next request will trigger the RateLimitException, and the response will be:

json
Copy
{
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded for user: john_doe"
}
Key Expiration: After 60 seconds, Redis resets the count for rate_limit:john_doe, and the user can make new requests.

✨ Customizing the Rate Limit
You can easily modify the rate limit settings to suit your needs.

In the RateLimitService.java, change:

java
Copy
private static final int LIMIT = 5; // Max number of requests
private static final int TIME_WINDOW_IN_SECONDS = 60; // Time window (in seconds)
For example, set LIMIT = 10 for 10 requests per user in 30 seconds.

🔧 Handling Errors
If the rate limit is exceeded, the system throws a RateLimitException, which is caught by a global exception handler. The handler returns:

HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
A message like: "Rate limit exceeded for user: john_doe"
This helps keep your API clean and user-friendly.

🎨 Conclusion
This demo app shows how easy it is to implement rate limiting with Redis and Spring Boot. By leveraging Redis’ in-memory data structure store, we can efficiently track and limit the number of requests per user in a given time window.

You’ve now got a powerful rate-limiting mechanism that can help protect your API from abuse, without overcomplicating your architecture. 🚀
